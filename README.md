This is just for my personal record keeping and refrence, if you happen to sumble upon these and want too use 
them to learn programming, feel free, that is why they are released under the MIT licsence. But if you are 
planning to use them to turn in as a grade for your programming class, yes they work, but don't you wont learn
anything, there is no reason to copy my code, programming one is not a dificult course, just do it yourself. Once 
you do it for yourself feel free to come back and check your code and see if you did everything corectly.
If you still choose to cheat and copy this for a grade, it is your loss and there is nothing I can do to stop you.
